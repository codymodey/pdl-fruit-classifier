# 🍏🍌 Apple vs. Banana Classifier (PDL Project)

This project applies **Deep Learning** to classify images of apples, bananas, and others.  
We explored two different approaches: **Transfer Learning (ResNet18)** and a **custom CNN architecture**.  
The best models are deployed as an interactive app on **[Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/rhkraptor/BananaOrApple)**.
